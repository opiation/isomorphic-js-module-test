# A test

The goal of this example repo is to prove whether it's possible to have a
type-safe library written entirely in ES6-compatible JS that can execute as-is
in a ES6-compliant browser, Deno and Node without any build tools. JSDoc is used
to leverage the type safety offered by the Typescript compiler.
